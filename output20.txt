 Congratulations to the members, I hope that they don‚Äôt restrict the members just within UK cuz United has fans all over the world who have been supporting the club throughout and has gathered ample knowledge enough to be a part of this board. Through use of technology like Zoom and Teams meetings can be scheduled anytime, any part of the world, I believe it‚Äôs time to leverage technology to bring in fresh minds from outside UK like we got our first German manager. #GGMU

 Would have been great if the fans from outside of the UK were also there on this board. United doesn't have fans in the UK only and the members of this board will most probably not have weekly meetings.

From what I know the meetings will be held Quarterly, and the members can always attend it on Zoom, Google Meet, and other such platforms since even Joel Glazer himself does not attend meetings personally most of the time and prefers to do it online. #GGMU
